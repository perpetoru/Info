# Info
Hi In the end, who am I?
I'm Vladimir Kuchma, you probably think why I don't have repositories, but the fact is that all
repositories are hidden. One of my works Perpetoru-discord-bot I will upload the first version of this bot to my GIT.
When it opens, I don’t know, so far I’m finalizing it. I’m fixing all the errors in the future. I’m going to write an application to manage it in python and the eel library.
Forgive me if the bot is integrated under my server, if that is not always on the network, because I'm a little lazy).
And I did not upload it to the server. If that nickname is my site but it is abandoned, I decided not to suffer with it for now because the database flew (
My discord server: https://discord.gg/x6NwUtC .
If so far I have problems with roles and XmlHttpRequest So sorry I'm working on this)
Then I'll start a script that will check if the bot is on and if it is off then turn it on)
